# Changes (aug 22 2020)

#### Renamed images to avoid using same synset twice
##### 'knife' in tools to 'hunting_knife.n.01'
#### Removed 'glove' in 'household appliance' because 'glove.n.01' already exists in 'medical_instrument.n.01'
#### Added 'natural_object.n.01' and 'artifact.n.01' super categories to the inanimate general category, as described in neural science literature.

### It is suggested to download the updated image bank from OneDrive
