## Code to inventorize and see stimuli distribution across categories

### load_cib.py

#### Generate nested dictionnairies with "category, total items in category,
#### files in category and saves output to json file 'cib_inv.json'

#### Navigate the database
##### Navigate through categories as normal dict items
###### - a graphic variable explorer such as provided in Spyder is helpful -

## TO-DO

[] Complete the 'restaurant', 'house' categories & other places
[] Complete the 'tree' 2nd level category

##### - using SUN or COCO datasets?

[] Re-implement WN compatibility

##### In Spyder 4.x, wn.synset objects are returned as 'metacontainer' objects,
##### which use too much space to load them as in previous versions
